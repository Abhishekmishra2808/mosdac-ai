INSAT-3D in terms of Sensors and products. \nINSAT or the Indian National Satellite System is a series of multipurpose Geo-stationary satellites launched by ISRO to satisfy the telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search and rescue needs of India. Commissioned in 1983, INSAT is the largest domestic communication system in the Asia Pacific Region. The satellite is monitored and controlled by Master Control Facilities that exist in Hassan and Bhopal. INSAT-3DS is a multipurpose geosynchronous spacecraft with main meteorological payloads (imager and sounder). The main objectives for this mission are to provide an operational, environmental and storm warning system to protect life and property. INSAT3S is monitoring the earth’s surface, oceanic observations and also provide data dissemination capabilities. It provides Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) through two S-band transponders. The data acquisition and processing system is established at Space Applications Centre, Bopal Campus, Ahmedabad, India. The processing of INSAT-3DS data is taken place broadly in four steps. \n  1. Ground receiving system to receive data\n  2. Data Reception (DR) system to generate raw data (L0) files\n  3. Data Processing (DP) system to process L0 data and produce L1B data files (Calibrated and Geo located)\n  4. Product generation and Dissemination system\n\n\n  * [![हिन्दी](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/all/modules/languageicons/flags/hi.png) हिन्दी](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/node/2026?language=hi)\n\n\n## INSAT-3DS Menu\n  * [Mission](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds)\n    * [INSAT-3DS](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds)\n      * [Introduction](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3s-introduction)\n      * [Objectives](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3s-objectives)\n      * [SpaceCraft](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3s-spacecraft)\n      * [Payloads](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3s-payloads)\n      * [Data Products](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/internal/catalog-insat3s)\n      * [Documents](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3s-references)\n\n\n## Search\nSearch \n## Follow Us\n  * [![Facebook icon](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/all/modules/social_media_links/libraries/elegantthemes/PNG/facebook.png)](https://www.facebook.com/mosdac.sac.isro \"Facebook\")\n  * [![Youtube \\(Channel\\) icon](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/all/modules/social_media_links/libraries/elegantthemes/PNG/youtube.png)](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVkai9WIgY2ZgrlF_08Yeg \"Youtube \\(Channel\\)\")\n  * [![RSS icon](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/all/modules/social_media_links/libraries/elegantthemes/PNG/rss.png)](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/rss.xml \"RSS\")\n\n\nWebsite owned and maintained by MOSDAC, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Govt. of INDIA.\n  * [![CQW LOGO](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/docs/cqw_logo.gif)](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/docs/STQC.pdf \"Quality Certificate\")\n\n\n  * [Feedback](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/mosdac-feedback)\n  * [About Us](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/about-us)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/contact-us)\n  * [Copyright Policy](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/copyright-policy)\n  * [Data Access Policy](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/data-access-policy)\n  * [Hyperlink Policy](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/hyperlink-policy)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/privacy-policy)\n  * [Website Policies](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/website-policies)\n  * [Terms & Conditions](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n  * [FAQs](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/faq-page)\n\n\n  * [![ISRO](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/logo-transparent.png?itok=IUS20l-w)](http://www.isro.gov.in)\n  * [![Space Applications Center](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/saclogo.png?itok=_Jv4AuIn)](http://www.sac.gov.in)\n  * [![NationalPortal](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/india-gov_0.png?itok=yssAPH3m)](http://www.india.gov.in)\n  * [![MyGov](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/mygov_0.png?itok=Po-dzdT3)](http://mygov.in/)\n  * [![DigitalIndia](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/digital-india_0.png?itok=ntlP7atE)](http://www.digitalindia.gov.in/)\n  * [![DataPortal](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/data-gov.png?itok=qYA78FgB)](http://data.gov.in)\n\n\n\"Ver 3.0; Last reviewed and updated on 25 Jul, 2025& Served By: Web-Srv-Pri\n[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds \"Previous\")[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds \"Next\")\n[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds)\n[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds \"Previous\")[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds \"Next\")\n[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds \"Close\")[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds)[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds)[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds \"Pause Slideshow\")[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds \"Play Slideshow\")\n[Back to top](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/insat-3ds#top)\n",

In addition, INSAT-3A carries a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera which operates in the visible and short wave infrared bands providing a spatial resolution of 1 km. A Data Relay Transponder (DRT) operating in UHF band is incorporated for realtime hydro-meteorological data collection from unattended platforms located on land and river basins. The data is then relayed in extended C-band to a central location. INSAT-3A also carries another transponder for Satellite Aided  and Rescue (SAS & R) as part of India's contribution to the international Satellite Aided  and Rescue programme. INSAT-3A was launched by European Ariane-5G Launch Vehicle into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 200 km and an apogee of 35,980 km. The satellite is maneuvered to its final orbit by firing the satellite's apogee motor. Subsequently, the deployment of solar array, antennae and the solar sail is carried out and the satellite is commissioned after in-orbit checkout.\n \n\n हिन्दी",

The Megha-Tropiques has day, night and all-weather viewing capabilities; it passes over India almost a dozen times every day, giving scientists an almost real- time assessment of the evolution of clouds.\n  * [![हिन्दी](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/all/modules/languageicons/flags/hi.png) हिन्दी](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/node/72?language=hi)\n\n\n  * [Missions](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques)\n    * [ MeghaTropiques](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques)\n      * [Introduction](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques-introduction)\n      * [Objectives](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques-objectives)\n      * [SpaceCraft](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques-spacecraft)\n      * [Payloads](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques-payloads)\n      * [Data Products](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/internal/catalog-meghatropiques)\n      * [Documents](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques-references)\n\n\n## Search\nSearch \n## Follow Us\n  * [![Facebook icon](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/all/modules/social_media_links/libraries/elegantthemes/PNG/facebook.png)](https://www.facebook.com/mosdac.sac.isro \"Facebook\")\n  * [![Youtube \\(Channel\\) icon](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/all/modules/social_media_links/libraries/elegantthemes/PNG/youtube.png)](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVkai9WIgY2ZgrlF_08Yeg \"Youtube \\(Channel\\)\")\n  * [![RSS icon](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/all/modules/social_media_links/libraries/elegantthemes/PNG/rss.png)](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/rss.xml \"RSS\")\n\n\nWebsite owned and maintained by MOSDAC, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Govt. of INDIA.\n  * [![CQW LOGO](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/docs/cqw_logo.gif)](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/docs/STQC.pdf \"Quality Certificate\")\n\n\n  * [Feedback](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/mosdac-feedback)\n  * [About Us](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/about-us)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/contact-us)\n  * [Copyright Policy](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/copyright-policy)\n  * [Data Access Policy](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/data-access-policy)\n  * [Hyperlink Policy](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/hyperlink-policy)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/privacy-policy)\n  * [Website Policies](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/website-policies)\n  * [Terms & Conditions](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n  * [FAQs](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/faq-page)\n\n\n  * [![ISRO](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/logo-transparent.png?itok=IUS20l-w)](http://www.isro.gov.in)\n  * [![Space Applications Center](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/saclogo.png?itok=_Jv4AuIn)](http://www.sac.gov.in)\n  * [![NationalPortal](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/india-gov_0.png?itok=yssAPH3m)](http://www.india.gov.in)\n  * [![MyGov](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/mygov_0.png?itok=Po-dzdT3)](http://mygov.in/)\n  * [![DigitalIndia](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/digital-india_0.png?itok=ntlP7atE)](http://www.digitalindia.gov.in/)\n  * [![DataPortal](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/data-gov.png?itok=qYA78FgB)](http://data.gov.in)\n\n\n\"Ver 3.0; Last reviewed and updated on 25 Jul, 2025& Served By: Web-Srv-Pri\n[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques \"Previous\")[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques \"Next\")\n[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques)\n[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques \"Previous\")[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques \"Next\")\n[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques \"Close\")[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques)[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques)[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques \"Pause Slideshow\")[](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques \"Play Slideshow\")\n[Back to top](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/megha-tropiques#top)\n",

Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc\n \n\n हिन्दी",

The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget, Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and  Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR).

The observations of SAPHIR  provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels.  A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017.

            "Megha- Tropiques (MT) is a joint Indo-French collaborative satellite mission, which is launched on 12 October 2011. The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget and Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and  Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR  provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels.  A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation."

rainfall\n![Rainfall](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/saphir_rain.jpg?itok=HGUH8nsw)\nMegha- Tropiques (MT) is a joint Indo-French collaborative satellite mission, which is launched on 12 October 2011. The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget, Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels. A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation. \n### Data Access\n[Click Here](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/opendata/bayesian_saphir_rainfall/) to access the Science Products.

    "main_content": "GSMap ISRO Rain  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GSMaP_ISRO is a precipitation product that was developed through the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) - Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Implementation of Agreement (IA) specifically for the Indian subcontinent. It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1°X 0.1° on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022). \n \n\nData Access\nScience products are available to download with a Single Sign On on MOSDAC.

\n![](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/PLOT_MOSDAC.png?itok=WBMtA-jN)\nThe GSMaP_ISRO is a precipitation product that was developed through the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) - Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Implementation of Agreement (IA) specifically for the Indian subcontinent. It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1°X 0.1° on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022). \n### Data Access\nScience products are available to download with a Single Sign On on MOSDAC.

    "main_content": "Inland Water Height \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is crucial to know how the storage of inland water bodies change over time. Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies (presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir) has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.\n \n\nData Access\nClick Here to access the Science Products .

Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies (presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir) has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.\n### Data Access\n[Click Here](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/opendata/inland_water_height/) to access the Science Products .

Chander and Prakash Chauhan, 2013) of the SARAL mission.\n\n\n### Limitations\n  * Based on the availability of the Altimeter dataset over the study region (Data Gap, altimeter track loss, bad weather, etc.).\n\n\n### Known problems with data\n  * Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain)\n\n\n### Related data collections\n  * GPS Field trip for water level measurement was conducted over Ukai reservoir on 9th November 2013, 17th January 2014 and 2nd January 2015.\n  * Brahmaputra observed river water level data was collected for 6 locations from upstream to downstream from Inland Waterways Authority (IWAI) and Central Water Commission (CWC) along with the satellite pass synchronous field trips.\n\n\n### File Naming Convention\n  * altimeter_derived_water_height_ukai_yyyymmdd_v1\n\n\n### MetaData\nSr. No | Core Metadata Elements | Definition  \n---|---|---  \n1 | Metadata language | English  \n2 | Metadata Contact | MOSDAC  \n3 | Metadata date | March 05, 2015  \n4 | Data Lineage or Quality | Water height estimation over inland water bodies using radar altimeters  \n5 | Title | Inland Water Bodies Monitoring using Satellite Altimetry over Indian Region  \n6 | Abstract | Inland water bodies? heightshave been estimated using SARAl-Altika and Jason-2 data over the two test sites, i.e. Ukai reservoir and Brahmaputra River (10 sites from upstream to downstream locations within the Indian region).

    "main_content": "Global Ocean Surface Current \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Ocean Surface Current defined here as the average current for the top 0 to 30m layer is derived from the synergistic use of three different satellite derived parameters. The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials.\n \n\nData Access\nClick Here to access the Science Products .

The basic equations are those of quasi linear and steady flow in a surface layer where the horizontal velocity U = (u,v) is allowed to vary with vertical coordinate z, and where vertical turbulent mixing is characterized by an eddy viscosity A uniform with depth. The vertical shear Uz reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H. Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nifU = - (1/ρm) ∇ p + AUz\n(1a)\n\n\n(1/ρm) pz = -g + ∇θ\n(1b)\n\n\n∇θ = g χT ∇SST ,\n(1c)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nwith - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nUz (z=0) = τ / A\n(2a)\n\n\nUz (z = -H) = 0\n(2b)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nThe characteristic density is ρm = 1025 kg m -3,\nThe acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s-2,\nand the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10-4 K-1,\nThe vector field τ = τx + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρm,\nH has been chosen to be 70 m,\nThe parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1)b | w| 1 m s-1 where W1 = 1 m s-1 , a = 8 x 10-5 m 2 s-1 , and b = 2.2\nwhere W1 = 1 m s-1 , a = 8 x 10-5 m 2 s-1 , and b = 2.2 .\nThe equation for the velocity shear is\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nUz - (if/A) Uz = (1/A)∇θ\n(3)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nwhich is a second-order differential equation in velocity shear Uz , subject to the boundary conditions (2a,b). After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nifU0= -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/he)τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ\n(4)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nHere the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and he = (A/if )1/2 is complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth he = sqrt( 2A/|f|).\n \nUsing equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002).\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nAs the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents.\n\n\nKnown problems with data\n\n\nAs these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.\n\n\nRelated data collections\n\n\nOSCAR Currents: Bonjean, F, and G.

Ocean Surface Current](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/world_circulation-1.jpg?itok=dCbexBpU)\nThe Global Ocean Surface Current defined here as the average current for the top 0 to 30m layer is derived from the synergistic use of three different satellite derived parameters. The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials.\n### Data Access\n[Click Here](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/opendata/ocean_surface_current/) to access the Science Products .

    "main_content": "High Resolution Sea Surface Salinity \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bay of Bengal's high-resolution sea surface salinity has been reconstructed using a Lagrangian technique leveraging satellite data. The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993. Validation of this reconstructed product was conducted against in-situ datasets obtained from thermo-salinographs. Results indicate that the reconstructed product more accurately captures front formation compared to the original SMAP salinity fields.\n \n\nData Access\nScience products are available to download with a Single Sign On on MOSDAC.

Salinity\n![](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/SSS.png?itok=L2yN5e37)\nThe Bay of Bengal's high-resolution sea surface salinity has been reconstructed using a Lagrangian technique leveraging satellite data. The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993.

With smaller footprint than earlier satellite altimeters, SARAL/AltiKa has improved coastal performance. Specific waveform processing has been used in this product to derive along track geophysical parameters (Sea Surface Height, Significant wave height and wind speed) from the altimeter 40-Hz waveform data. This product is generated for Indian mainland coastal region (up to 50 km from the coast). This product is available for 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa starting from March 2013 through July 2016.\n \n\nData Access\nClick Here to access the Science Products .

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product.\n\n\n7\nDataset Contact\nAditya Chaudhary, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, aditya.osd@sac.isro.gov.in\n\n\n8\nUpdate frequency\n35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa have been processed.

Also it is not applicable on the equator.Vertical movement is ignored in isQG framework.isQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields.We considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach.This method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong.The vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m.\n\n\n\nKnown problems with data\n\n\nData problems due to bad weather (heavy rain) and extreme events like cyclones etc.\n\n\nFile Naming Convention\n\n\nNetcdf file: isQG_yyyy.nc\n\n\nMetaData\n\n\n\n\nSr. No\nCore Metadata Elements\nDefinition\n\n\n1\nMetadata language\nEnglish\n\n\n2\nMetadata Contact\nMOSDAC\n\n\n3\nMetadata date\nMay, 2018\n\n\n4\nData Lineage or Quality\nSea surface height anomaly, Sea surface density anomaly in Bay of Bengal using isQG methodology.\n\n\n5\nTitle\nReconstruction of Ocean interior density and horizontal velocity anomaly ﬁelds using Satellite data in Bay of Bengal\n\n\n6\nAbstract\nSatellite data has been used to reconstruct ocean interior density and velocity anomalies in the Bay of Bengal through the “interior + surface Quasigeostrophic” (isQG) method.

The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity.

The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak .\n### Data Access\n[Click Here](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/opendata/ocean_subsurface_fields/) to access the Science Products .

User should refer doi:10.1175/JPO-D-12-0204.1.\n\n\n### Limitations\n  * This method is only applicable in a region where the Coriolis parameter does not change abruptly. Also it is not applicable on the equator.  \nVertical movement is ignored in isQG framework.  \nisQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields.  \nWe considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach.  \nThis method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong.  \nThe vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m. \n\n\n### Known problems with data\n  * Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain) and extreme events like cyclones etc.\n\n\n###  File Naming Convention\n  * Netcdf file: isQG_yyyy.nc\n\n\n### MetaData\nSr. No | Core Metadata Elements | Definition  \n---|---|---  \n1 | Metadata language | English  \n2 | Metadata Contact | MOSDAC  \n3 | Metadata date | May, 2018  \n4 | Data Lineage or Quality | Sea surface height anomaly, Sea surface density anomaly in Bay of Bengal using isQG methodology.  \n5 | Title | Reconstruction of Ocean interior density and horizontal velocity anomaly ﬁelds using Satellite data in Bay of Bengal  \n6 | Abstract | Satellite data has been used to reconstruct ocean interior density and velocity anomalies in the Bay of Ben",

    "main_content": "Oceanic Eddies Detection  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe oceanic eddy parameter information was prepared for 24 years (1993 – 2016) over Bay of Bengal using AVISO. Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year.\n \n\nData Access\nClick Here to access the Science Products .

Al. 2007 in deriving the eddy census in Bay of Bengal with minor modifications in fixing the thresholds for eddy detection specific to this region. This was achieved after performing several trial experiments with different combinations of size and amplitude values.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nAccuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out. The number of eddies are depending upon the diameter and amplitude threshold. Only mesoscale eddies with maximum diameter of 400km are being considered.\n\n\nKnown problems with data\n\n\nLess reliability of SSH data near the coast with altimetry is a known problem.\n\n\nRelated data collections\n\n\nhttp://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/registration-form.html(link is external)\n\n\nFile Naming Convention\n\n\nThe typical file name is 'eddy_parameter_YYYY.nc' or ‘YYYY.gif’ where\n'eddy_parameter’ signifies that this product consists of eddy parameters.\n'YYYY' corresponds to the year, ex: 2015.\nAll the data files are in NetCDF 4 format and the images are in gif format.\n\n\nMetaData\n\n\n\n\nSr. No\nCore Metadata Elements\nDefinition\n\n\n1\nMetadata language\nEnglish\n\n\n2\nMetadata Contact\nMOSDAC\n\n\n3\nMetadata date\nDecember 12, 2017\n\n\n4\nData Lineage or Quality\nScience product of eddy parameters over Bay of Bengal.\n\n\n5\nTitle\nCharacterizing Ocean Eddy activities in the Bay of Bengal using Altimeter data\n\n\n6\nAbstract\nThe oceanic eddy parameter information over Bay of Bengal was prepared for 24 years (1993 – 2016) using AVISO merged and gridded satellite altimeter sea surface height (SSH) data.

Currents](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/eddy.png?itok=posWUVaZ)\nThe oceanic eddy parameter information was prepared for 24 years (1993 – 2016) over Bay of Bengal using AVISO. Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year.\n### Data Access\n[Click Here](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/opendata/oceanic_eddy/) to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data.\n### Data Version\n  * Version 1.0 (beta)\n\n\n### Data Sources\n  * The daily gridded map of Absolute Dynamic Topography data is obtained from AVISO\n  * ftp site (<ftp://ftp.aviso.oceanobs.com>)\n  * Website (<http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/>[(link is external)](http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/))\n\n\n### Processing Steps\n  * Remove the long wavelength component of the SSH anomaly and retain the mesoscale features with the wavelength 50-500 km scale.\n  * Identified outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly.\n  * The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria.\n  * Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials.\n  * Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters.\n  * Detected eddies are tracked individually.\n\n\n### References\n  * Chelton, D.

The SIC data were downloaded from NSIDC data site:(http://nsidc.org/data(link is external) (link is external)). The SIOP36 data consist of 366 data files corresponding to 366 days with the first file representing 1st January and the last, 31st December. The file naming nomenclature follows SIOP36_MMDD_S.bin[.tif/.png] format; where MM refers to month number (01 to 12, 01 being January), DD refers to date of the month, and the character S refers to Southern Hemishphere.\nData formats are indicated by .bin (Binary), .tif (GeoTIFF), and .png (Portable Network Graphics). Data is freely available to global scientific community and can be downloaded from www.mosdac.gov.in (link is external). Probability values are calculated from the long-term NASA Team algorithm-derived SMMR-SSM/I-SSMIS sea ice concentration product (Cavalieri, 1996). The dataset is given in Polar Stereographic projection with a grid size of 25km x 25km in latitude and longitude. The grid coordinates of the upper left pixel are 39.2 deg S, 42.2 deg W. There are 316 columns and 332 rows. Data values are stored as IEEE floats representing probabilities in the range 0-100%. Pixels with zero values corresponds to either Antarctic land/ice or ocean water.\nData Access\n\nClick Here to access the Science Products .

Probability](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/seaice-slide.jpg?itok=2a80t2Wx)\nThe Sea Ice Occurrence Probability (SIOP36) data were prepared from 36 years (October 1978 to December 2014) NSIDC sea ice concentration (SIC) data over the Antarctic Region (Cavalieri, 1996). The SIC data were downloaded from NSIDC data site:(<http://nsidc.org/data>[(link is external)](http://nsidc.org/data) (link is external)). The SIOP36 data consist of 366 data files corresponding to 366 days with the first file representing 1st January and the last, 31st December. The file naming nomenclature follows SIOP36_MMDD_S.bin[.tif/.png] format; where MM refers to month number (01 to 12, 01 being January), DD refers to date of the month, and the character S refers to Southern Hemishphere.\nData formats are indicated by .bin (Binary), .tif (GeoTIFF), and .png (Portable Network Graphics). Data is freely available to global scientific community and can be downloaded from [www.mosdac.gov.in](http://www.mosdac.gov.in) (link is external). Probability values are calculated from the long-term NASA Team algorithm-derived SMMR-SSM/I-SSMIS sea ice concentration product (Cavalieri, 1996). The dataset is given in Polar Stereographic projection with a grid size of 25km x 25km in latitude and longitude. The grid coordinates of the upper left pixel are 39.2 deg S, 42.2 deg W. There are 316 columns and 332 rows. Data values are stored as IEEE floats representing probabilities in the range 0-100%. Pixels with zero values corresponds to either Antarctic land/ice or ocean water.\n**Data Access**\n[Click Here](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/opendata/sea_ice_probability/) to access the Science Products .
